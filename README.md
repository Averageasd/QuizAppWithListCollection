# MCQ Quiz App

## About
Practice project where I built out a MCQ quiz app that records
student's score. The app shows student each question 1 by 1. When user
finishes answering a question, user's question will be checked against
the correct answer. If user's question match, they will receive 10 points. After the test is over, total score will be shown.

## Why
I built this project to practice creating and designing OOP system. 
Most importantly, I cemented my understanding of C# Collections.

## Note
Note that I hardcoded data in the class QuizSystem instead of taking users' input. I just wanted to practice OOP and C# Collections so I just needed to have some dummy data that I could work with.
